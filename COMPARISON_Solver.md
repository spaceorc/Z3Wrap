### Recommendations

#### Priority 1: Add High-Level Wrapper for Z3_mk_solver_for_logic

**Benefits**:
- Significant performance improvements for specialized logics
- Better integration with SMT-LIB2 standards
- More predictable behavior for known problem classes

**Implementation Steps**:
1. ✅ Add P/Invoke binding in NativeLibrary.Solver.cs (COMPLETED)
2. Add high-level method to Z3Context: `CreateSolverForLogic(string logic)`
3. Add enum or constants for common logics (QF_LIA, QF_BV, etc.)
4. Add tests demonstrating performance benefits
5. Update documentation with logic selection guidance

**Example Usage** (after high-level wrapper):
```csharp
// Create solver optimized for bit-vector logic
using var solver = context.CreateSolverForLogic("QF_BV");

// Create solver optimized for linear integer arithmetic
using var solver = context.CreateSolverForLogic("QF_LIA");
```

#### Priority 2: Document Logic Selection

1. Document how Z3 automatically detects logic
2. Provide guidance on problem formulation for best performance
3. Explain when logic-specific solvers matter most

### Combined Coverage
| Category | Functions | Implemented | Percentage |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Basic Solver (Solver.cs) | 14 | 14 | 100% |
| Advanced Extensions (SolverExtensions.cs) | 17 | 17 | 100% |
| **Total Core Solver API** | **31** | **31** | **100%** |

## Conclusion

**NativeLibrary.Solver.cs is 100% COMPLETE** for basic solver operations.

The file correctly implements all 14 basic solver functions including:
- Four solver creation variants (general, simple, from-tactic, for-logic)
- Complete reference counting
- All assertion and checking operations
- Full backtracking support
- Model extraction
- Parameter configuration
- State management

**Combined with NativeLibrary.SolverExtensions.cs**, we achieve **100% coverage** (31/31 functions) of the core Z3 Solver API.

**Status**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** - All solver operations fully implemented and documented at the P/Invoke level. High-level wrappers for Z3_mk_solver_for_logic in Z3Context would provide easier access to logic-specific solver optimization.
